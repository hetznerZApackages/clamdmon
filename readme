What's this
===========

    ClamdMon is a little program for checking ClamAV daemon health.
ClamdMon send to clamd stream, which contain EICAR test signature.
If virus found, ClamdMon will return 1, otherwise 0.
It's time to verify database integrity or/and restart ClamAV daemon...

Install
=======

Under the root account:

make
make install

On default, ClamdMon will be installed in the /usr/local/sbin/
If it run without any parameters, TCPSocket mode will be used.
If you want to use LocalSocket mode of ClamAV daemon, run it
in such form: clamdmon -p LocalSocket, where LocalSocket is path
to socket from clamd.conf file.

Don't forget to inspect and edit clamdmon.sh as you wish.
Don't forget to add cron job for root like this:

*/5 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/clamdmon.sh
